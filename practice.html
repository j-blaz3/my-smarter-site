			Why I love Taos, N.M.
		</h1>
    <h2>
			The sun is strong and the people are weird.
		</h2>
			<p>
				Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
				than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the
				residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)
			</p>
			<p class="important">
				Warning: We have no slow lorises here.

				Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up
				the genus Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a
				variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent.

			<p class="pretty">Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh 
				and Northeast India in the west to the Phillipines in the east, and from Yunnan
				province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south.
