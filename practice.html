    <h1>Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
    <h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>
			<p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
					than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the
					residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)

				Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up
				the genus Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a
				variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent.
